     WHY DO WE USE CDN LINKS?

    We use CDN links for several important reasons:

    1. Improved Load Times

    Faster Content Delivery: Since CDNs have servers distributed globally, using a CDN link allows users to load resources (like JavaScript libraries, CSS files, or images) from the server closest to them, significantly reducing load times.
    Parallel Downloads: Browsers limit the number of concurrent connections to the same domain. By using CDN links, assets are fetched from different domains, allowing parallel downloads and faster page rendering.

    2. Reduced Server Load

    Offloading Traffic: By serving resources via a CDN, you reduce the load on your own servers. This is particularly useful during high traffic periods, as the CDN handles most of the content delivery.
    Efficient Caching: CDNs cache the resources across multiple servers, meaning the same content doesn't have to be repeatedly fetched from your origin server.

    3. Better Reliability and Availability

    Redundancy: CDNs are designed to provide high availability. If one server fails, another server in the network can deliver the content, ensuring minimal downtime.
    Global Reach: CDNs have multiple servers around the world, making sure that content is available and delivered efficiently to users regardless of their location.

    4. Security Enhancements

    Protection Against DDoS Attacks: CDNs often include features that protect against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by distributing traffic across their network.
    SSL/TLS: Many CDNs offer SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transfer, enhancing website security.

    5. Version Control and Popularity

    Popular Libraries: Many widely-used libraries (like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.) are hosted on CDNs. Using the CDN link ensures that the user is likely to have a cached copy of that resource, reducing the need to download it again.
    Versioning: CDNs often allow you to specify the version of a library you want to use, ensuring compatibility and stability for your application.

    WHAT IS CROSSORIGIN IN CDN LINK? AND WHY TO USE IT?

    The crossorigin attribute in CDN links is used to manage how browsers handle requests for resources that are loaded from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the one serving the web page. This attribute is important for security and privacy, particularly in the context of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

    =========================================================================================================
    Purpose of crossorigin in CDN Links:

    1. Handling Cross-Origin Requests:
    When you load a resource (like a script, image, or stylesheet) from a CDN that is on a different origin (domain) than your website, it's considered a cross-origin request. The crossorigin attribute tells the browser how to handle these requests.

    2. Controlling Resource Sharing:
    It helps in controlling whether the browser should include credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication) in the requests to the CDN.
    It also determines if the browser should expose the resource to JavaScript (for example, when using the fetch API).

    =========================================================================================================
    Key Values:

    1: anonymous:
        No credentials are sent with the request.
        Used for public resources.

    2: use-credentials:
        Credentials are included in the request.
        Used when the resource requires authentication.

    3:No crossorigin Attribute:
    If the crossorigin attribute is not specified, the browser will treat the request as a simple request, which doesn't include credentials. The resource might not be accessible if the CDN requires credentials or CORS headers.

    <script src="https://cdn.example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

    This tells the browser to load script.js from the CDN without sending any credentials, which is generally safe and recommended for public resources.

    <!-- <script src="app.js"></script> -->

    <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
    <!-- type="module": This attribute indicates that the JavaScript file you're including should be treated as a module. 
    Modules allow you to use import and export statements to manage code dependencies and share functionality between different files.
    By specifying type="module", you're telling the browser that the script follows modern JavaScript module syntax. -->
